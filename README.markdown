Formula Inverse a high-speed racing game where the track can curve any which way. I built this game with my friend [@garyluu](http://twitter.com/gluu) for the "video game competition" project of my graphics class in college.

## Controls

Control player 1 with w/a/s/d keys for movement and q for boost.
Control player2 i/j/k/l keys for movement and u for boost

## Installation

1. Install SDL, SDL\_ttf, and SDL\_image libraries
2. Go into src/ directory and type "make"
3. Run the game with "./racer" from src/. To make it fullscreen, run "./racer full"

## Todo

This game has a sweet motion blur effect that's turned off since it needs special support from the graphics card to be performant. If you search through the code you can find what parts were commented out.
