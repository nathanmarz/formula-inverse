DESCRIPTION

   A plugin player model for Quake2.

   Just unzip the files contained in the archive, to your
   Quake2 folder, RESTORING PATHNAMES. This means
   that if you're using Winzip, you must enable the
   "Use Folder Names" option when extracting. For
   pkunzip users, make sure you use the -d option.

   To use Astroboy go to the mutliplayer setup and choose the Astro
   model instead of the male or female players.
   
   To use Astroboy as an Eraser Bot edit the BOT.CFG and include 
   the line:
   "Astro"        "astro/astro"        3   3   3   8   1   0
   under the title [bots]. you can edit the various strengths by
   changing the numbers following the name.

   to me by email: Jonny@pobox.com

COMMENTS

   Please ask if you want to use the model for anything other than 
   personal use as it is explained here, particularly if incuding it 
   in a patch or add-on.
